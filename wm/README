yawm - dynamic window manager
============================
yawm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X,
originally developed as DWM by suckless.org team.


Requirements
------------
In order to build yawm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (yawm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install yawm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

Running yawm
-----------
Use a utils/.xinitrc as an example of start-up script for your instance of
yawm and yawm.run wrapper in order to get yawm properly running.

In order to connect yawm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec yawm

(This will start yawm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

Configuration
-------------
The configuration of yawm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
