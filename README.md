YaWm
====

YaWm is just Yet Another Window Manager for everyday use. Another meaning of the project name is al-yawm [the day] (YaWm/wiki):

Originaly the code was forked from suckless's dwm, but for now I'm pretty sure that
no patches from dwm might be applied to yawm - they became completely different.

The goal of the project is to get a comfortable working environment in unix way:
simple, flexible and strictly functional binary code that should help user to work
with his tasks with a maximal performance and high usability.
Not more But not less.
