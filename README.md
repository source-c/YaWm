YaWm
====

YaWm is just Yet Another Window Manager for everyday use. Another meaning of the project name is al-yawm [the day] (arabic):

-- the time from sunrise to sunset

-- and - the present time.

-- and from that [meaning - the present time] came in the dear revelation [the Quran] :

   "This day al-yawm have I perfected your religion" [Yusuf Ali, in reference to Quran verse 5:3].

-- and - (in astronomy): the time it takes the Earth to revolve around its axis, which is twenty four hours.

Originaly the code was forked from suckless's dwm, but for now I'm pretty sure that
no patches from dwm might be applied to yawm - they became completely different.

The goal of the project is to get a comfortable working environment in unix way:
simple, flexible and strictly functional binary code that should help to user work
with his tasks with maximal performance and high usability.
Not more But not less.
