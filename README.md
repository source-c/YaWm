YaWm
====

`YaWm` is just Yet Another Window Manager which is used by me from early 2012. Another meaning of the name is al-yawm [the day] (YaWm/wiki):

Originaly inspired by suckless's dwm. Reworked, patched, polished for my needs.
Not have pretensions to be compatible with the original anymore.

The main goal is to build comfortable X environment in true unix way:
simple, flexible and strictly functional binary code that should help user to work
with his tasks with a maximal performance and to bring a high usability.
Not more But not less.

Minimal toolset (also partialy covered by this repo):
- yawm
- yawmstatus
- tinyterm
- slock
- dmenu

Optionally, I'd recommend:
- clipit
- volumeicon-alsa
- surf
- tabbed
- any other stuff you wish...

In order to run the WM xinit and base X stuff are required.

Happy hacking!
